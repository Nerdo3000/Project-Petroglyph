# Petroglyph
This Datapack changes the entire overworld world generation, so that all of it is made out of deserts. Water is scarce and not renewable (no infinite water sources), but you will need it to survive. The Hydration system is based on your movement, exposure to daylight and location. You will need to live a nomadic lifestyle to survive the harsh desert. There are a few ways to renewably get water, but thats for you to figure out.

There are new structures, including the 
- Crypts (generate in deserts)![The crypts outside](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/78802b2df6922cddfed78900524dd46f667bcba2_0.webp)
- Pyramids (generate in badlands)![The Pyramid](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/e6e529e520adee6f1fccca39bd745910cb14ce3d_0.webp)
- Oases (generate in deserts)![An oasis](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/851fb5e6123f12e273c406285ac964608a474392_0.webp)
- Suspicious sand patches (generate in deserts)![A suspicious sand patch](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/ec92f475f613b25edba6f583366040ea51d1d03c_0.webp)
- Desert tradesmen outposts (generate in deserts)![A tradesmen outpost](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/7a28d840ac935736964b6a62aab70eca4bb6e0d5_0.webp)
- Camp (generate in every biome, as it allways generates near 0 0)![A Camp](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/4a03ec7fce87813abee560c4e291ae3069871d18_0.webp)
  
Many of these structures contain suspicious sand, from which you can uncover new artifacts and gems. Gems are collectible items, which give you a permanent bonus. You can view youre collected Gems in a new Advancement tab. Keep those brushes ready!![The Gems Advancement Tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/74948fb547230c467f761320512fc1ceffe2a366.png)


The Datapack also features a new boss mob: the Pharao. You can find it in the Pyramid, but it is advised to prepare yourself beforehand, as it's a tough fight!![The Pharao Boss and Mummy Minions in the Background](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d4e8140ec88c91dc2f67c1dbdce715d995860ebc_0.webp)

# Resource Pack
The Data Pack comes with a optional resource Pack. If you install the Data Pack, you can download the resource Pack seperatly. If you install the mod version, the resource pack should be automatically installed (versions 1.3+). The resource Pack IS NOT REQUIRED, but recommended. For example it does this:![Normal Mummy on the left; Improved Mummy on the right!](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/e26ac73f4ffc0e8da81386daec7cd0983edd79dd_0.webp)

# Guide
<details>
<summary>A Guide to Petroglyph</summary>
<ul>
<li> When you spawn, find the campsite near the world spawn, as it contains some starting equipment</li>
<li> Take the cauldron and try to craft a bucket</li>
<li> Depending on your sourroundings, either try to find an Oasis or a Village. If you spawn in a Badlands/Mesa Biome, exit it as soon as Possible!</li>
<li> Collect the water you find using the bucket and use empty Glass Bottles in your crafting 4x4 to get Water Bottles</li>
<li> Keep an eye on your Hydration Level and Rate:</li>
<ul>
<li> If your Hydration Level drops bellow 0, you will die and won't be able to respawn.</li>
<li> Your Hydration Rate depends on exposure to daylight (during the day), the Biome you are in (Badlands cost you more water) and how active you are (Jumping and Sprinting).</li>
<li> If you get Hold of a Saddle, Tame a Camel: You will lose less hydration because of Activity. </li>
<li> Try to Travel at Night: You will lose less hydration because of being in sunlight!</li>
<li> Some gems or armor also reduce hydration loss.</li>
<li> You can't get water from soucre blocks!</li>
<li> Try to collect paper, which you may use to purify water. Purified water gives you double the hydration of normal water. To purifie water, just take a piece of paper and combine it with a water bottle in a crafting grid.</li>
<li> Try to buy dripstones from the tradesmen. If you want to know why, go read: <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pointed_Dripstone#Cauldrons" target="new">Minecraft Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<li> When you find a Crypt:</li>
<ul>
<li>Beware of Traps: they are everywhere.</li>
<li>You can also find very good loot.</li>
<li>You may also find a Map, which will lead you to the Pharao's Temple.</li>
<li>If you have a brush, excavate the suspicious sand. It contains pottery sherds (which you can trade for emeralds, with the Tradesmen Villagers), gems (which you also can trade for emeralds, with the Tradesmen Villagers), gear and usefull items (mainly paper).</li>
</ul>
<li> When you find a Tradesmen Outpost, you can trade your collected loot, buy and steal water. </li>
<li> When you find a Pillager Outpost, you can sometimes steal water from them. Note: Pillagers won't respawn in outposts.</li>
<li> When want to defeat the Pharao Boss:</li>
<ul>
<li>Get a Pharao Locator Map.</li>
<li>Be aware, that the Pharao only spawns in Badlands/Mesa Biomes.</li>
<li>Bring enough water, as the Pharao increases your Hydration Rate (to about -9)!</li>
<li>Be aware, that you will be in gamemode adventure during the Bossfight!</li>
<li>Be aware, that you won't be able to exit the bossfight until you or the Pharao dies!</li>
<li>The Pharao will summon different Minions, which will try to shred your armor.</li>
<li>The Pharao itself can one-shot you.</li>
<li>You will be blinded at the half way point.</li>
<li>The Pharao will drop very, very, very good loot, when you defeat it.</li>
<li>Good Luck!</li>
</ul>
